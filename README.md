# Introduction To Zeek
Broâ€™s creators describe it as an open-source traffic analyzer. It is typically used to inspect all traffic on a link (in depth) for signs of malicious or suspicious activity.
That being said Bro can also be used for network troubleshooting and various measurements within a network.
By deploying Bro, blue teams can immediately access a variety of log files that contain all kinds of network activity, at a high level. More specifically, those logs contain not only detailed records of every connection on the wire but also application-layer transcripts (for example - DNS requests and the respective replies, whole HTTP sessions, etc.). Bro does a lot more than just keeping track of the aforementioned.
It is also shipped with a whole range of analysis and detection capabilities/functions.
